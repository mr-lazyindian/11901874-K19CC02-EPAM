Glacier: 
Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) is a secure and durable service for low-cost data archiving and long-term backup.
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) also provides three Amazon S3 Glacier archive storage classes.
These storage classes are designed for different access patterns and storage duration. These storage classes differ as follows:
S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval – Use for archiving data that is rarely accessed and requires milliseconds retrieval.
S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly the S3 Glacier storage class) – Use for archives where portions of the data might need to be retrieved in minutes.
Data stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class can be accessed in as little as 1-5 minutes by using Expedited retrieval. You can also request free Bulk retrievals in up to 5-12 hours.

S3 Glacier Deep Archive – Use for archiving data that rarely needs to be accessed. Data stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class has a default retrieval time of 12 hours.
