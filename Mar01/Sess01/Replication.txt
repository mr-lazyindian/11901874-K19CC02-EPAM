Replicating objects:
Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets.
You can replicate objects to a single destination bucket or to multiple destination buckets. 
The destination buckets can be in different AWS Regions or within the same Region as the source bucket.
To automatically replicate new objects as they are written to the bucket, use live replication, such as Cross-Region Replication (CRR).
To replicate existing objects to a different bucket on demand, use S3 Batch Replication.

Why use Replication:
Replicate objects while retaining metadata.
Replicate objects into different storage classes.
Maintain object copies under different ownership.
Keep objects stored over multiple AWS Regions.
Replicate objects within 15 mins.
Sync buckets, replicate existing objects, and replicate previously failed or replicated objects.
Replicate objects and fail over to a bucket in another AWS region.
