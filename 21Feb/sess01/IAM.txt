-> has users, policies, groups, roles.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Working of IAM:
-> Principal 
-> Authentication 
-> Request Authorizations 
-> Actions 
-> Resources
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Users:
-> Users are AWS entities that represent the person or application tha interacts with AWS.
-> Users have a name and credentials.
-> Root user of an AWS account is not the same as an IAM user with administrator access.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Groups:
-> A set of IAM users is referred to as an IAM user group.
-> User groups allow you to specify permissions for many users, making it easier to manage those user's permissions.
-> In  resource-based policy, a user group cant be designated as a Pirncipal. A user group is a technique to 
apply policies to a group of people all at once.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roles:
-> Role, like an IAM user, is an AWS identity with permission that govern what the identity can and cannot do in AWS.
-> There are no long-term credentials connected with a role.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Policies:
-> These are linked to IAM identities, or AWS resources to manage access in AWS.
-> A policy is an object that defines the rights of an identity or resource when it is associated with it.
->AWS examines them when a user submits the request.
