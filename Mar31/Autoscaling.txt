-> It monitors ypur applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the 
lowest possible cost.
-> Its easy to setup application scaling for multiple resources across multiple services in minutes.
-> services include: EC2, ECS...!
-> Autoscaling -> Explore applications -> Discover what you can scale -> Choose what to optimize -> Track scaling as it happen.

Scaling techniques:
dynamiuc, predictive, scheduled.
1) Dynamic: Adapts to changing environments and responds with the EC2 instances as per the demand.
It helps the user to follow the demand curve for the application, which ultimately helps the maintainer/user to scale the instances a head of time.
2) Predicted: Helps you to schedule the right number of EC2 instances on the predicted demand.
You can use both dynamic and predictive scaling approaches together for faster scaling of the application.
3)Scheduled: allows you to scale your appliucation based on the scheduled time you set.

Benefits:
1) Setup scaling quickly: lets you set target utilization levels for multiple resources in a single, intuitive interface.
You can quickly see the average utilization of all your scalable resources without having to navigate to other consoles.
2) Make smart scaling decisions: Let you build svaling plans that automate how groups of different resources respond to changes in demand. 
3) Automatically maintain performance: You maintain optimal application performance amd availability.
4) Pay only for what you need,
Scaling policies, Application dependencies, Cost.
