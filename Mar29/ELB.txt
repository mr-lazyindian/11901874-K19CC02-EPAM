load balancer -> listeners -> Rules -> target groups
listeners(port and protocol)
target group(logical grouping of targets, cam contain upto 1000 targets(EC2, IP, ECS)
Targets(EC2, ECS and Ip addresses, single target can be registered with multiple target groups, IP addresses
both accessible within your VPC and dbx)
Rules(listener can have one or more rules, conditions and actions, forward requests to a specified group)
