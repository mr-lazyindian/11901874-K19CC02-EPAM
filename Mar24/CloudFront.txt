1) Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, 
such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users.
2) CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations.
3) When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the request is routed to the edge location that provides 
the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.
4) If the content is already in the edge location with the lowest latency, CloudFront delivers it immediately.
5) If the content is not in that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an origin that you've
defined—such as an Amazon S3 bucket, a MediaPackage channel, or an HTTP server

uses:
Accelerate static website content delivery.
Serve private content by using Lambda@Edge customizations.
Customize at the edge.
Encrypt specific fields throughout system processing.
Serve video on demand or live streaming video.

CloudFront or S3?
Amazon CloudFront is a good choice for distribution of frequently accessed static content that benefits from 
edge delivery—like popular website images, videos, media files or software downloads.
