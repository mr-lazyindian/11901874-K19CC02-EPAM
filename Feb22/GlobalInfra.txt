Global Infrastructure:
AWS cloud infrastructure is built around AWS regions and availability zones.
An aws region is physical location in the world.
availability zones consist of data centres.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GLobal components are:
Availability zones (AZ): These are distinct locations within an AWS region that are engineered to be isolated from failures
in other availability Zones. Meaningful distance of separation. Unique power infrastructure. Many 100Ks of servers at scale.
Data centers conneced via fully redundant and isolated metro fiber. Fully isolated infrastructure with one or more data centres.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regions: A region is a specific geographical location where yo can run your resources.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edge ocations: These are AWS datacentres dsigned to deliver services with the with the lowest latency possible
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.
Regional Edge caches: It is used in between region and edge locations during lo latency.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Global And Region AWS architecture:
-> Global Service Location and Discovery.
-> COntent delivery and Optimizations.
-> Global Health Check and Failover.
-> Regional End point.
-> Scaling ad Resilience.
-> Application Service and components.
