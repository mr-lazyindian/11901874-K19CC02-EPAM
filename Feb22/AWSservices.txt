Public vs Private services:
Public services are accessible to everyone having internet connection and public endpoint.
Private services are under VPC and not accessible to everyone. Anyone with credentials can have access to private services.
AWS Private zone: VPCs are isolated unless configured otherwise.
ON_PREMISES can access VPCs only if configured via VPN or Direct Connect.
AWS Public zone: Private services can be given a public IP translated by IGW.
Public Internet zone: Access to public AWS using internet as transit.
Private networks can be connected together if only if we allowed it.
