AWS Cloud9 is an integrated development environment, or IDE.
The AWS Cloud9 IDE offers a rich code-editing experience with support for several programming languages and runtime debuggers, and a built-in terminal. 
It contains a collection of tools that you use to code, build, run, test, and debug software, and helps you release software to the cloud.
You access the AWS Cloud9 IDE through a web browser.
You can configure the IDE to your preferences. You can switch color themes, bind shortcut keys, enable programming language-specific syntax coloring and code formatting, and more.

AWS Cloud9 environments
An AWS Cloud9 environment is a place where you store your project's files and where you run the tools to develop your applications.

Using the AWS Cloud9 IDE, you can:

Store your project's files locally on the instance or server.

Clone a remote code repository—such as a repo in AWS CodeCommit—into your environment.

Work with a combination of local and cloned files in the environment.

You can create and switch between multiple environments, with each environment set up for a specific development project. By storing the environment in the cloud, your projects no longer need to be tied to a single computer or server setup. This enables you to do things such as easily switch between computers and more quickly onboard developers to your team.
