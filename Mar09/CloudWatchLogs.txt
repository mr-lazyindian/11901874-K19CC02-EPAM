Log events:
A log event is a record of some activity recorded by the application or resource being monitored.
The log event record that cloud watch logs understands contain two properties.

Log streams:
A log stream is a sequence of log events that share the same source.
A log stream is generally intended to represenet the sequence of events coming from the application instance or resource being monitored.


Log groups:
Define groups of log streams that share the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings.
Each log stream has to belog to one group.

Metric filters:
Yiu cann use metric filters to extract metric observations from ingested events and transform them to data points in cloud
watch metric.
Metric filters are assigned to log groups, and all the filterss assigned to a log group are applied to their log streams.

Cloud watch for EC2:
By default, no logs from EC2 machine will go to cloud watch.
You need to run cloud watch agent on EC2 to push the log files you want.
Make sure IAM mpermissions are correct.
Install the agent on a running EC2 instance.
