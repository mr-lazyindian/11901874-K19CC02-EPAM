->Enables a user to link a docker container to as many networks he/she requires.
->These are used to provide complete isolation for docker containers.
->Benefits:
->They share a single OS and maintain containers in an isolated env.

->Docker supports networking for its containers via network drivers. These drivers have several network drivers.

Bridge:
->Private default network created on host.
->Container slinked to this network have an internal IP ddress through which they communivcate with each other easily.
-> The docker daemon creates a virtual ethernet bridge docker0 that operates automatically, by delivering packets 
among various network interfaces.

Host:
-> It is a public network.
->It utilizes the host's IP address and TCp port space to display the services running inside the container.
-> It effectively disabes network isolation between the docker host and docker containers.

None:
-> In this network driver, the docker contaoners will neither have any access to external networks nor will it be 
able to communicate with other containers.
->This option is used when a user wants to disable the networking access to the container.
-> In simple terms, None is called a loopback interface.

Overlay:
->This isnutilized for creating an internal private network to the docker needs in the docker swarm cluster.
->Docker Swarm is a service for containers which facilitates developer teams to build and manage a cluster of docker 
nodes in docker platform.

Macvlan:
->It simplifies the communication process b/w containers.
->This network  assigns a MAC address to the docker container. WIth this MAC address the Daemon routes the network
traffic to a router.
