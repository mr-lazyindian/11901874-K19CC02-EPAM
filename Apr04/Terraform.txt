-> Terraform: Infrastructure as a Code (IaC).
-> tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you 
can version, reuse, and share.
-> You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle.
-> Terraform can manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, 
as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

How terraform work:
-> Terraform creates and manages resources on cloud platforms and other services through their application 
programming interfaces (APIs).

Stages in terraform:
-> Write: You define resources, which may be across multiple cloud providers and services.
-> Plan: Terraform creates an execution plan describing the infrastructure it will create, update, 
or destroy based on the existing infrastructure and your configuration.
-> Apply: On approval, Terraform performs the proposed operations in the correct order, 
respecting any resource dependencies.
