EFS is a fuly managed, highly scalable, and highly available file storage service provided by AWS.
Serverless, fully elastic file storage.

Benefits:
Scalability, Durability, Performance, Comoatability, Integration with other AWS services.

Main components of architecture:

-> File systems: Fullyu managed NFS system that can be accessed from multiple EC2 instances simultaneously.
-> Mount targets: Users need to create mount targets in their VPC. A mount target is an endpoint in the VPC that allows
EC2 instances to connect to the EFS file system using NFS protocols. Mount targets can be created in one or more AZ to 
provide high availabilty and durability.
-> NFS: EFS uses the NFS to allow EC2 instances to mount file systems and access data stored in them.
-> Metadata Service:A metadata service that keeps track of file system formation, such as file and directory 
attributes and ACL's.
-> Data Replication: replicates data across multiple AZ to ensure durability and availability of systems.
-> Security and Compliance: Security featurs like encryption at rest and in transmit, IAM based control, 
and network isolation to protect data.
