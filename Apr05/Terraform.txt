Two basic approaches to designing automation processes:
1) Imperative: work-flow based. how you do something.
2) Declarative: model-based. what you want, but not how tomake things happen.

Idempotency refers to the property that a terraform operation can be repeated multiple times without changing 
the end result.


state pus: used to manually upload a local file to remote state.
also works with local state.
state pull: manually download and output the state from remote state and works as well with local state.

Components of terraform architecture:
Terraform configuration files.
Terraform state file.
Infrastructure as Code.

Cloud APIs or other infrastructure providers
Providers: AWS, AZURE, GCP. These allow Terraform to create and manage resources on those platforms.

Module in Terraform:
source, name, version.

Private module registry.

Terraform commands:
terraform init: this command initializes a terraform working directory by downloading and installing necessary dependencies.
