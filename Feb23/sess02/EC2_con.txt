EC2 -  Security group:
-> Like a virtual fire wall.
-> Ingress and Egress.
-> Changes in security groups configuration acts immediately.
-> By default everything on AWS is private. All inbound traffic is blocked by default.
-> If we do not allow a particular protocol no one will ever be able to access our instance using that protocol.
-> Any rules edit on security group have immediate effect.
