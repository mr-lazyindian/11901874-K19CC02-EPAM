EC2:
Elastic compute cloud.
-> Provides resizable computer capacity in the cloud.
-> Virtual machine in the cloud.
-> Webservice from Amazon that provides resizable compute servies in the cloud.
-> They are resizable because you can quickly scale up or scale down.
-> An instance is a virtual for running applications on Amazon server.
-> Pay as you use.
-> Choose linux or windows.
-> Choose across regions and avaialability zones for reliability.
-> You can launch as many or as few virtual servers in cloud.

Features:
-> Virtual computing environments, known as instances.
-> Preconfigured templates for your instances, known as Amazon Machine Images.
-> Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity for your instances, known as instance types.
-> Secure login information for your instances using key pairs.
-> Storage volumes for temporary data that deleted when you stop or terminate your instance, known as instance stire volumes.
-> Multiple physical locations for your resources, such as instances and amazon EBS known and availability zones.
-> A f0irewall that enables you to specify the protocols, parts and source IP ranges that can reach your instances using
security groups.
-> Static IPv4 addresses for dynamic cloud computing as Elastic IP addresses.
